MediCube is a web app for managing medicines via QR codes, offering details like manufacturing and expiry dates, usage, and dosage. It sends automatic Gmail and web notifications for expiring meds and reminders. Built with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX, it tracks medicine usage and prevents illegal disposal.
